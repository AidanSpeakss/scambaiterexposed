  <h1><a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Scambaiter">Scambaiter</a> mods were banned for not supporting illegal acts.</h1><p>
I spent the weekend at the misses house. I got home and found that all mods on the Scambaiter Discord server have been banned.
<br><br>
  <b><i>Why?</i></b>
<br><br>
Because we didn't support or condone kids doing illegal stuff like stealing accounts, money, and details from victims we dedicate our time to saving.

It seems like some members of the Scambaiter community have gone full potato. They seem to think it's OK to steal money from scammers, even though they've stolen it from innocent people.

We are currently collating evidence and more information will be available soon. We want to make sure the response is clear, concise and cogent.</p>
