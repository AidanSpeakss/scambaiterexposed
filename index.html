  <h1>What Needs to Be Said About <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Scambaiter">Scambaiter</a> (Tr3way)</h1>
  <h2>Why are we writing this?</h2>
  <p>
    We are Scambaiters old mod team, we are longtime fans, and many of us are seasoned cyber-security experts or University Students. We have the expertise and experience that can keep victims safe, whilst still shutting down these scam call centers.  And originally Scambaiter used us for his videos. We have helped Scambaiter with his discord server, with providing content for his videos, and even assisted in creating videos for him. We all tried to look out for him, we gave him advice, and helped lead the channel to where it is today.
    <br><br>
    However, in the past several months Scambaiter has stopped listening to our advice and has behaved in a way in which we feel we need to speak out. His business decisions and choices have been disgraceful, deceptive, and very dangerous to the victims he is trying to protect. This includes, but is not limited to: intending to steal from scammers, taking bad sponsorships, misleading viewers, and allegedly using inexperienced teenage hackers to perform attacks on scammers. These teenagers shut down months worth of work by other scambaiters, tried to steal gift cards from victims, and made serious mistakes in their attacks that a seasoned hacker would not make.
    <br><br>
    As mods and long-time fans, we believe we have given more than enough leniency, and enough is enough. We kept calling out this behavior trying to bring things back in line but we have only been pushed out of his community, for trying to do what is right. Now we have reached a point where all we can do is send you this message through a DM and hope that you see it. Below is proof of everything Scambaiter has done. Please stop supporting him, this is all we desire. We are not seeking revenge, we just want to protect you and the victims he could hurt if this continues.
  </p>
  <h2>Bad Sponsorships and Misleading Viewers</h2>
  <p>
    Let's clarify our position and say that sponsorships themselves are not bad and necessary to fund a youtube channel. That is unless the sponsorship has a shady history, misleads the viewer of its capabilities, and the product itself conflicts with the background of the channel. Scambaiters sponsor NordVPN qualifies for all three of the criteria I listed as being an awful sponsor. NordVPN itself has been hacked before where user data may have been compromised may alone raise the eye of why it appears on hacking/scambaiting channel. If you want to read more about the NordVPN hack I recommend reading (<a href="shorturl.at/kDQTW">shorturl.at/kDQTW</a>) or why SomeOrdinaryGamers discontinued his sponsorship with NordVPN after the breach (<a href="shorturl.at/oyMV0">shorturl.at/oyMV0</a>).
    <br><br>
    The most egregious part of the sponsorship is the fact that Scambaiter misleads the viewers on the capabilities of NordVPN. Namely, he claims that Nord VPN will protect you from getting hacked and being a victim of malware. Namely, he states that you “NEED NordVPN if you don’t want to end up like this guy (insert scammer).” You will hear this quote in this video <a href="https://youtu.be/o2ixj0m4F_E?t=648">https://youtu.be/o2ixj0m4F_E?t=648</a>. Under almost no circumstance will a VPN protect you from a remote access trojan, infostealer, or similar types of malware. To imply that it would be deceiving his viewers which he does numerous times shilling NordVPN.
    <br><br>
    The mod team itself was displeased with the NordVPN sponsorship as we felt it degraded the channel's credibility for short-term profits for Scambaiter. It just became evident that Scambaiter valued money over credibility or the thoughts of his own community. Especially, since the past several months we promoted Mullvad VPN which will work for scambaiting while NordVPN would not. In fact, many of us mods would routinely steer people away from NordVPN while the sponsorship was ongoing.

  <h2>Scambaiter Stealing from Scammers</h2>
  <p>
    Scambaiter at one point intended to steal Bitcoin from a scammer. While this might not seem wrong, this behavior would make him no better than the scammers he fights against. He admitted to trying to login into a scammers paxful account, to steal their Bitcoin in this YouTube comment:

  <h2>Imminent Monitoring / Revamp Allegations</h2>
  <p>
    The Imminent Revamp group (originally called Imminent monitoring) was a group with which Scambaiter was affiliated. Scambaiter received connections to scammers PC's from Imminent Revamp to use in his videos. Even though Scambaiter is not responsible for the actions of Imminent Revamp, he is responsible for being negligant and not vetting the group well enough. While Imminent Revamp has evolved over time and is much better now, it does not mean that people shouldn't know about their past. There are many allegations against the group from that time, that people need to hear about. Just know that these are allegations, and that there is only testomonie from people who were there when these events occured. It's still important that we talk about them, even if they can't be proved. A lot of evidence for these allegations was lost because Scambaiters old discord server was banned and all of the mods that we're in it, were also banned. Most of the evidence relevent to these allegations were in the conversations on these Discord accounts, where are now lost. With all that said, here are the allegations towards the old Imminant Revamp group:
    <br><br>
    <strong>This is all alleged:</strong><br>
    The Imminent Revamp group's goal was best defined as amassing hacked PCs first rather than helping the victims. More connections resulted in more laughs for the immature kids who worked in it and more content for Scambaiter to work with. How do one or two or even three people manage to monitor 100+ hacked PCs? They don’t. They sometimes gave away hacked scammer PCs to new members or for higher-level testing. We would not have a problem with this until you realize that some of the PCs scammers use are sold to other people when the scammers no longer have a use for them. One such PC was sold to a child, and Imminent Revamp had no idea because they did not monitor the connections. One of the Imminent Revamp members was responsible for this negligence, and let this happen. We did not know how long this kid had owned that PC, which was still backdoored by the IR group (Imminent Revamp). When a member of our group figured out the PC was not even owned by a scammer anymore, he immediately contacted the victim and warned him that he needed to clean out his PC. The group simply was not capable or responsible enough to handle the PCs they hacked.
    <br><br>
    The Imminent Revamp’s thirst for hacking scammers’ PCs meant that they actually bumped into other scambaiting groups when they invaded call centers. These scambaiting groups helped with other large channels you may be a fan of, like Jim Browning. However, the Imminent Revamp group was very noisy as they operated. They ended up dropping various strains of remote access trojans. Our mod team had seen over 8 unique remote access trojans on one pc controlled by the imminent revamp group. Obviously, this slows the PC to a noticeable level (scammers don’t usually have access to the latest pcs and specs) and leads to the scammer finding out his PC is hacked. Worse the imminent revamp group’s lower level members had done stupid things on the scammer PCs such as showing dump pop-ups or redirecting them to meatspin. The group's immaturity had frustrated other scambaiting groups as it had caused them to lose call centers they were documenting for either youtube or the authorities.
    <br><br>
    In addition to their immature behavior, members of our group witnessed members of Imminent Revamp trying to steal gift cards from victims.

  <h2>Scambaiter's Response</h2>
  <p>
    Response to introduction:
    <br>---------------------------------<br>
    First of all I want to start off by saying that it is indeed true that my old mod team wrote this 'article' about me and that they indeed helped me tremendously with my Discord server. In the last couple of weeks I have not spoken to them as I made the conscious decision of removing them from my Discord server as I felt they were a fundamental issue for the longevity of that same server. In the introduction it is stated that I steal from scammers, that I take bad sponsorships and that I use inexperienced teenage hackers to help my channel grow, which is all untruth that I will address later on.
    <br><br>
    Bad sponsorships:
    <br>---------------------------------<br>
    Regarding the part about NordVPN being a bad sponsor, I would beg to differ. Yes, NordVPN has had a leak in the past, but that doesn't mean it is completely unsafe and it also does not mean that I am trying to 'sell' my viewers something that will endanger their privacy and/or safety. I think this leak was a huge mistake on their part, but mistakes are to learn from and with the current state that NordVPN is in, I am, with my current knowledge about them, willing to collaborate with their brand. Also, I never claimed that a VPN protects you against malware, I used a bridge to smoothly flow over into the integration part of that sponsored video by saying it might be a good idea to protect your identity (IP address) by getting a VPN so that you don't end up like the scammer (ref. easily being tracked/hacked). I understand that this might come over as confusing and maybe even as misleading if you take it to a certain context. I would like to apologise to anyone that I might have convinced of the fact that a VPN can operate as an anti-virus program. The interpretation by the mod team of me being money-hungry, is, again, taken completely out of context. I have had discussions with them about NordVPN and I told them that I truly believed it wasn't a bad VPN, it just could not be used to get remote access to scammers as they don't allow port forwarding because they do not want people hacking with their VPN. I personally use NordVPN on my host machine, it is always turned on by default, but I do use a different VPN to hack scammers ony my virtual machines as this is not possible with Nord, otherwise I would definitely use their service for this as well.
    <br><br>
    Imminent Monitoring:
    <br>---------------------------------<br>
    It is true that my friends are my friends because we have the same passion of hacking scammers and stopping them from taking money from innocent people. The allegations about blackhat activities being performed by people in my group are all complete bogus. We also do not have the aspiration to get thousands of connections at a time, that is not what drives us. Our passion is scambaiting and part of that is indeed getting new call centers to then monitor them and undermine their fraudulent business. My friends are extremely savvy when it comes to spreading access through very large call centers and it could thus be possible that some of us have had many connections at a time. Whenever we notice one of those connections succesfully scamming someone, we never hesitate but to stop that scam from happening. It is of course true that we can not monitor hundreds of connections at a time, but if we did not spread our access to those machines, then those scams would also not be stopped by anyone else. There is no difference in us having the PC and not watching it or us not having it at all and thus not even having the possibility of noticing a succesfull scam to then stop that from happening. That is also part of the reason why we share connections with each other: to make it possible for people with fewer connections to monitor those unmonitored centers, to prevent scams from happening.
    <br><br>
    We have indeed bumped into other scambaiting groups in the past few months as a result of us going after the same types of scams. It does not happen often, but it has happened. We have had no issues with those groups (i.e Lewis' Tech, Jim Browning etc.), except for one group, which are the Shadow Hunters. They are close friends of the old mod team that wrote this article. They were, for example, running a RAT called 'Orcus Anti-Takedown' on a connection called Julia, but ironically enough they forgot to 'take down' the warning message of this software after which the scammer was notified that he was being monitored. This resulted into us losing that specific connection. Not only are they very noisy when it comes to monitoring, they also sinkhole other groups their stubs, which basically means that they remove remote access of other people, making it impossible for them to save potential victims. They acknowledged the fact that they did this and found that 'they were the better group' and they were 'better at saving victims than us'. The claims about my group being extremely noisy are also false, we do not drop more than 2-4 files on the scammers' computer and I have also never heard of any of my friends redirecting scammers to Meatspin. If there is more than 4 connections on a computer, then it is likely that those stubs got put onto that machine externally (i.e different groups).
    <br><br>
    Furthermore, it is stated in the article that groups like Jim Browning's have had issues with my group. This is quite ironic to me as my team works closely together with Jim Browning's team and the connections for his latest video were actually provided to him by my group. We have also helped his group with patching vulnerabilities in the tools they use and with plugins such as 'scammer speaker capture' to improve Jim's videos.
    <br><br>
    The allegation of me stealing from scammers is, yet again, false. The only thing I do whenever I can not prevent a victim from buying a gift card is to send it over to a friend of mine that is able to cancel those gift cards, which I also frequently state in my videos. The screenshot of an 11-month-old comment of mine, saying that I tried to log into a Paxful account is not photoshopped, I posted that. In this comment I claimed to have tried logging into a scammer's crypto account, not necessarily that I tried stealing the money. Even if I were to be ignorant enough back then to log into that account and somehow take their money, I would never keep this to myself. You can ask the people in my group about discussions we have had regarding the 'ethicalness' of stealing scammers' money. They can vouch that I am strongly against doing this as I feel that, by doing this, you are indirectly stealing victims' money. We did discuss taking the scammers their money, if we were to ever get the opportunity, so that we could then contact victims and refund them or to donate the money to a scam-victim related charity, were the victims to not be interested in a refund. We did conclude that that was not the right thing to do and thus have never done this before. Up until now, we have never stolen any money from scammers and I am personally not planning on doing this, ever.
    <br><br>
    I hope this clears things up.
    <br><br>
