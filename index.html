  <h1>What Needs to Be Said About <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Scambaiter">Scambaiter</a> (Tr3way)</h1><p>
      <h2>Why are we writing this?</h2>
      <p>
        We are Scambaiters old mod team, we are longtime fans, and many of us are seasoned cyber-security experts or University Students. We have the expertise and experience that can keep victims safe, whilst still shutting down these scam call centers.  And originally Scambaiter used us for his videos. We have helped Scambaiter with his discord server, with providing content for his videos, and even assisted in creating videos for him. We all tried to look out for him, we gave him advice, and helped lead the channel to where it is today.
        <br><br>
        However, in the past several months Scambaiter has stopped listening to our advice and has behaved in a way in which we feel we need to speak out. His business decisions and choices have been disgraceful, deceptive, and very dangerous to the victims he is trying to protect. This includes, but is not limited to;  stealing from his patrons, taking bad sponsorships, and using inexperienced teenage hackers to perform attacks on scammers. These children have hacked other scambaiters, stolen gift cards from victims, shut down months worth of work by other scambaiters, and made serious mistakes in their attacks that a seasoned hacker would not make.
        <br><br>
        As mods and long-time fans, we believe we have given more than enough leniency, and enough is enough. We kept calling out this behavior trying to bring things back in line but we have only been pushed out of his community, for trying to do what is right. Now we have reached a point where all we can do is send you this message through a DM and hope that you see it. Below is proof of everything Scambaiter has done. Please stop supporting him, this is all we desire. We are not seeking revenge, we just want to protect you and the victims he could hurt if this continues.
      </p>
      <h2>Bad Sponsorships and Misleading Viewers</h2>
      <p>
        Let's clarify our position and say that sponsorships themselves are not bad and necessary to fund a youtube channel. That is unless the sponsorship has a shady history, misleads the viewer of its capabilities, and the product itself conflicts with the background of the channel. Scambaiters sponsor NordVPN qualifies for all three of the criteria I listed as being an awful sponsor. NordVPN itself has been hacked before where user data may have been compromised may alone raise the eye of why it appears on hacking/scambaiting channel. If you want to read more about the NordVPN hack I recommend reading (shorturl.at/kDQTW) or why SomeOrdinaryGamers discontinued his sponsorship with NordVPN after the breach (shorturl.at/oyMV0).
        <br><br>
        The most egregious part of the sponsorship is the fact that Scambaiter misleads the viewers on the capabilities of NordVPN. Namely, he claims that Nord VPN will protect you from getting hacked and being a victim of malware. Namely, he states that you “NEED NordVPN if you don’t want to end up like this guy (insert scammer).” You will hear this quote in this video (add video and timestamp) and in other scambaiter videos. Under almost no circumstance will a VPN protect you from a remote access trojan, infostealer, or similar types of malware. To imply that it would be deceiving his viewers which he does numerous times shilling NordVPN.
        <br><br>
        The mod team itself was displeased with the NordVPN sponsorship as we felt it degraded the channel's credibility for short-term profits for Scambaiter. It just became evident that Scambaiter valued money over credibility or the thoughts of his own community. Especially, since the past several months we promoted Mullvad VPN which will work for scambaiting while NordVPN would not. In fact, many of us mods would routinely steer people away from NordVPN while the sponsorship was ongoing.

<h2>Imminent Monitoring / Revamp</h2>
  <p>
    The Imminent Revamp group (originally called Imminent monitoring) is the group with which Scambaiter is most affiliated and was started when his channel started to blow up (100k Subs). It was mostly composed of younger fans (under 18) that helped Scambaiter get connections to scammers' computers for his videos. Essentially; 3-4 members would gather every day and call scammer numbers, then try to hack their PCs with known methods such as Anydesk reverse connection and the use of NanoCore RAT. The connections that were best for YouTube, such as those with a webcam would be given to Scambaiter to make a video.
<br><br>
    In fact, Scambaiter’s most viral, a video with over 20 million views called “SHOWING a SCAMMER HIS OWN WEBCAM ON MY PC” was only possible because of a hack done by BobbinsScambaits, a member of the Imminent Revamp group. Simply put, one of the most infamous youtube hackers makes viral content off PCs he did not even hack.
    <br><br>
    Although Bobbins may want to deny he was taken advantage of, his work  hacking this scammer’s pc made Scambaiter tons of money and he never got a penny of it. Altogether, members of the Imminent Revamp members have hacked over a hundred computers for Scambaiter and given him a huge pool of content to work with. Which has allowed Scambaiter to perform significantly less work while taking all the credit.
    <br><br>
    Obviously, having many aspiring hackers giving you content to make videos with, makes Scambaiters' business much easier.  Unfortunately, the Imminent Revamp members that make content for him also partake in many heinous criminal/blackhat acts that Scambaiter brushes off because they make content for him.
    <br><br>
    <h2>IR ( Imminent Revamp) Homewrecking and Stealing Gift Cards</h2>
    The Imminent Revamp group's goal is best defined as amassing hacked PCs first rather than helping the victims. More connections result in more laughs for the immature kids who work in it and more content for Scambaiter to work with. How do one or two or even three people manage to monitor 100+ hacked PCs? You don’t. They sometimes give away hacked scammer PCs to new members or for higher-level testing. We would not have a problem with this until you realize that some of the PCs scammers use are sold to other people when the scammers no longer have a use for them. One such PC was sold to a child, and Imminent Revamp had no idea because they did not monitor the connections. One of the Imminent Revamp members known as “The Midnight”, a.k.a Midnight, a.k.a Skidnight, was responsible for this negligence, and let this happen. We do not know how long this kid had owned that PC, which was still backdoored by the IR group (Imminent Revamp. When Sinister (a member of our mod team) figured out the PC was not even owned by a scammer anymore, he immediately contacted the victim and warned him that he needed to clean out his PC. The group simply is not capable or responsible enough to handle the PCs they hack.
    <br><br>
    The Imminent Revamp’s thirst for hacking scammers’ PCs has meant that they actually bump into other scambaiting groups when they invade call centers. These scambaiting groups help with other large channels you may be a fan of but I will not mention to keep other channels out of the drama. However, the Imminent Revamp group is very noisy as they operate as they end up dropping various strains of remote access trojans. The mod team has seen over 8 unique remote access trojans on one pc controlled by the imminent revamp group. Obviously, this slows the PC to a noticeable level (scammers don’t usually have access to the latest pcs and specs) and leads to the scammer finding out his PC is hacked. Worse the imminent revamp group’s lower level members have done stupid actions on the scammer PCs such as showing dump pop-ups or redirecting them to meatspin. The group's immaturity has frustrated other scambaiting groups as it has caused them to lose call centers they were documenting for either youtube or the authorities.
